# Global section - values below can be overwritten by command line flags

# How the image is parsed to get the colors:
# full - resized - wal - thumb -  fastresize - kmeans
backend = "fastresize"

# What color space to use to produce and select the most prominent colors:
# lab - labmixed - lch - lchmixed - lchansi
color_space = "lch"

# Use the most prominent colors in a way that makes sense, a scheme color palette:
# dark - dark16 - darkcomp - darkcomp16 - ansidark - ansidark16
# light - light16 - lightcomp - lightcomp16
# harddark - harddark16 - harddarkcomp - harddarkcomp16
# softdark - softdark16 - softdarkcomp - softdarkcomp16
# softlight - softlight16 - softlightcomp - softlightcomp16
palette = "softdark16"

# Ensures a "readable contrast" (OPTIONAL, disabled by default)
# Should only be enabled when you notice an unreadable contrast frequently happening
# with your images. The reference color for the contrast is the background color.
check_contrast = true

# Color saturation, between [1% and 100%] (OPTIONAL, disabled by default)
# usually something higher than 50 increases the saturation and below
# decreases it (on a scheme with strong and vivid colors)
saturation = 55

# Alpha value for templating, by default 100 (no other use whatsoever)
# alpha = 100

# Thershold is the difference between similar colors , used inside the colorspace.
# Each colorspace may have different results with different thresholds, meaning
# you should try which one works for you best.
# 1        Not Perceptible by human eyes.
# 1 - 2    Perceptible through close observation.
# 2 - 10   Perceptible at a glance.
# 11 - 49  Colors are more similar than opposite.
# 100      Colors are exact opposite.
# threshold = 16
